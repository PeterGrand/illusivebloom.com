                Hi, I'm Shannon—founder of Illusive Bloom. This brand grew out of my deep love for both science and scent—two seemingly different worlds that, to me, feel deeply connected.
            </p>
            
            <p class="mb-6">
                With a background in biochemistry, I began quietly blending botanicals in search of a hair perfume that felt as natural as it was beautiful. What began as a personal experiment soon unfolded into a much deeper creative journey.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif font-bold text-sage-800 mb-4">The Birth of Illusive Bloom</h2>
            
            <p class="mb-6">
                Illusive Bloom grew from a desire to capture the soul of Nature in scent. Every perfume I create is made exclusively with natural materials—botanical oils, organic extracts, CO2s, concretes, absolutes, tinctures, and natural isolates. These ingredients come from fruits, flowers, roots, seeds, leaves, moss, lichen, woods, bark, and resins. I also do my own extractions using steam distillation, enfleurage, and ethanol.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-8">
                In 2020, I used my stimulus funds to invest in the supplies I needed to start this business. But Illusive Bloom is more than a business—it's a practice. A perfumery grounded in curiosity, intention, and a deep reverence for scent. In perfumery, you're not just influencing how someone smells—you're influencing how they feel and remember.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    I've had the privilege of training with renowned perfumer Mandy Aftel and have received <strong>Slow Scent Certification</strong> through her program at Aftelier. This comprehensive training has deepened my understanding of natural perfumery techniques and the artistry of scent creation.
