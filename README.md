The official website for Illusive Bloom, a natural perfumery specializing in handcrafted botanical fragrances.

## About Illusive Bloom

Illusive Bloom creates unique artisan fragrances handcrafted in Efland, NC. Founded in 2020, the brand grew from a deep love for both science and scent—combining a background in biochemistry with the art of botanical perfumery.

Every perfume is made exclusively with natural materials including botanical oils, organic extracts, CO2s, concretes, absolutes, tinctures, and natural isolates sourced from fruits, flowers, roots, seeds, leaves, moss, lichen, woods, bark, and resins. The brand also creates custom extractions using steam distillation, enfleurage, and ethanol.

Illusive Bloom is more than a business—it's a practice grounded in curiosity, intention, and deep reverence for scent. In perfumery, you're not just influencing how someone smells—you're influencing how they feel and remember.
